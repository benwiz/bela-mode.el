;; TODO defcustom for bbb-address. Make sure to have a good default. Maybe have a default for bela-scripts-dir, it's mainly for me anyway.
;; TODO a flag for force overwrite. It's `--force` on build_project.sh
;; TODO need to get project directory somehow
;; BBB_ADDRESS=root@192.168.6.2 ./build_project.sh ../examples/Fundamentals/print/
